# House of Tide — Complete To-Do List

## Overview

This plan implements the three highest-impact changes with testing at each stage. Each feature gets: implementation → Playwright tests → manual playthrough → git commit.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Sequential Implementation Only

**Implement ONE task at a time.**

After completing each task:
1. Run Playwright tests
2. Complete manual playthrough
3. Git commit
4. Mark task as ✅ COMPLETE in this document
5. Say: "Ready for Task [X]" where X is the next task number

**Do not start Task 2 until Task 1 is marked complete.**
**Do not start Task 3 until Task 2 is marked complete.**

---

## Phase 1: Consequence Preview on Choices ✅ COMPLETE

### Implementation Steps

**1.1 Add risk detection logic**
- Create `analyzeChoiceRisk()` function that examines choice text for keywords
- Returns risk object: `{ cost: number|null, requirement: string|null, warning: string|null }`
- Keywords to detect:
  - Cost: "commission", "buy", "hire", "bribe" → estimate marks cost
  - Requirements: "dispatch", "send ships", "fleet" → check ship count
  - Warnings: "challenge", "confront", "publicly" → Pell caution

**1.2 Modify choice rendering**
- Update `renderChoices()` to append risk indicators
- Format: choice text + `<span class="choice-hint">(requires 200mk)</span>`
- Style: subtle, italic, slightly darker color

**1.3 Update AI prompt**
- Add instruction: when generating choices, include cost/requirement hints in the choice text itself
- Example: "Commission a second vessel from the Masso yards — this will require approximately 600 marks."

### Testing

**Playwright test (`tests/choice-preview.spec.js`):**
```javascript
- Start new game
- Advance to first house event
- Verify 3 choices rendered
- Check for risk indicators (if present)
- Select choice with cost indicator
- Verify marks deducted appropriately
```

**Manual playthrough:**
- Play through 3 full years
- Verify risk indicators appear on expensive/risky choices
- Confirm indicators are helpful, not spoilers
- Check that choices without risks don't show false indicators

**Git commit:**
```
feat: add consequence preview to choices

- Add risk detection for costs, requirements, warnings
- Update choice rendering with subtle hints
- Modify AI prompt to include cost estimates
- Tested: Playwright + 3-year manual playthrough
```

## Phase 2: Rival Family Memory ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Status:** State exists, auto-tracking missing | **Priority: P1** | **Next task after background fix**

### Implementation Steps

**2.1 Add rival state to game state** ✅ DONE
```javascript
// Already exists in hot-engine.js line 59-64
rivals: {
  borracchi: { relationship: 0, lastInteraction: 0, notes: [] },
  spinetta:  { relationship: 0, lastInteraction: 0, notes: [] },
  calmari:   { relationship: 0, lastInteraction: 0, notes: [] },
  liyuen:    { relationship: 0, lastInteraction: 0, notes: [] }
}
```

**2.2 Create rival tracking functions** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] `updateRivalRelationship(family, delta, reason)` — adjusts relationship score
- [ ] `detectRivalInChoice()` — scans choice text for rival family names
- [ ] `getRivalContext()` ✅ Already exists (line 268)

**2.3 Update AI prompts** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] Auto-update relationships after each choice
- [ ] Add rival names to `SYSTEM_PROMPT` context

**2.4 Auto-track relationships** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] After each choice, scan for rival names
- [ ] Positive keywords ("alliance", "help", "accept offer") → +1
- [ ] Negative keywords ("decline", "challenge", "dismiss") → -1
- [ ] Add note to rival.notes array: "Year 7: declined marriage arrangement"

**2.5 Add rival summary to status bar** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] Hover tooltip on dynasty label shows rival standings
- [ ] Format: "Borracchi: Allied (+2) · Spinetta: Hostile (-1) · Calmari: Neutral (0)"

### Testing

**Playwright test (`tests/rival-memory.spec.js`):** ✅ Created (skipped until implemented)

**Manual playthrough:**
- [ ] Play 10 years, deliberately ally with Borracchi
- [ ] Snub Spinetta twice
- [ ] Verify later events reflect these relationships
- [ ] Check that rival context appears in AI-generated text
- [ ] Test rival tooltip in status bar

**Git commit:**
```
feat: add persistent rival family memory

- Track relationship scores for Borracchi, Spinetta, Calmari
- Auto-detect rival interactions in player choices
- Pass rival history to AI in all event generation
- Add rival standings tooltip to status bar
- Tested: Playwright + 10-year playthrough
```

---

## Phase 3: Mid-Year Trading Layer ⚠️ PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Status:** State exists, UI missing | **Priority: P2** | **After Phase 2 complete**

### Implementation Steps

**3.1 Add trading state** ✅ DONE
```javascript
// Already exists in hot-engine.js line 57-58
cargo: { saltfish: 0, wine: 0, alum: 0, tin: 0 },
marketPrices: null,
```

**3.2 Create market price generator** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] `rollMarketPrices()` — generates prices based on season + random variance
- [ ] Winter: salt fish expensive, wine cheap
- [ ] Summer: wine expensive, salt fish cheap
- [ ] Spring/Autumn: balanced
- [ ] Events can set price modifiers: "alum shortage" → alum +40%

**3.3 Build trading UI panel** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] New panel: `panel-trading` (appears after Routes, before year-end)
- [ ] Shows 4 commodities with buy/sell prices
- [ ] Input fields for quantity
- [ ] Buy/sell buttons with validation (marks available, ship capacity)
- [ ] Capacity display: "Cargo hold: 120/300 units (3 ships)"

**3.4 Add trading phase to game loop** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] After Routes phase completes → show trading panel
- [ ] Player can buy/sell multiple times
- [ ] "Finish Trading →" button advances to year-end
- [ ] Auto-advance if player has no ships (can't trade)

**3.5 Integrate with AI events** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] AI can mention commodity situations: "The northern alum mines are flooded"
- [ ] These hints affect market prices next trading phase
- [ ] Add to AI prompt: "Recent market: alum shortage (price +35%)"

**3.6 Add cargo to save/load** ⬜ TODO
- [ ] Serialize cargo and marketPrices state
- [ ] Display in save slot details: "180 units cargo"

### Testing

**Playwright test (`tests/trading-layer.spec.js`):** ✅ Created (skipped until implemented)

**Manual playthrough:**
- [ ] Play 5 years using trading actively
- [ ] Test buy low / sell high strategy
- [ ] Verify capacity limits work (try to buy 400 units with 3 ships)
- [ ] Check that AI event hints (e.g., "wine shortage") affect prices
- [ ] Test with 0 ships (should skip trading phase)
- [ ] Save/load with cargo in hold

**Git commit:**
```
feat: add mid-year trading layer

- Implement 4-commodity market with seasonal pricing
- Add cargo capacity system (100 units per ship)
- Create trading UI panel between Routes and year-end
- Integrate market events with AI narrative
- Add cargo to save/load system
- Tested: Playwright + 5-year trading playthrough
```
- Integrate market events with AI narrative
- Add cargo to save/load system
- Tested: Playwright + 5-year trading playthrough
```

## Testing Infrastructure Setup

### Initial Setup (before Phase 1)

**Install Playwright:**
```bash
cd house-of-tide
npm init -y
npm install -D @playwright/test
npx playwright install
```

**Create test structure:**
```
tests/
  ├── choice-preview.spec.js
  ├── rival-memory.spec.js
  ├── trading-layer.spec.js
  └── helpers.js  # shared test utilities
```

**Base test helper (`tests/helpers.js`):**
```javascript
export async function startNewGame(page, dynasty = 'TestHouse', founder = 'Tester') {
  await page.goto('file://' + process.cwd() + '/house-of-tide.html');
  await page.click('button:has-text("Begin the Founding")');
  await page.fill('#input-dynasty', dynasty);
  await page.fill('#input-founder', founder);
  await page.click('button:has-text("Open the Ledger")');
  // Skip onboarding
  await page.click('button:has-text("Skip")');
}

export async function waitForEvent(page) {
  await page.waitForSelector('#event-text', { state: 'visible', timeout: 30000 });
}

export function getGameState(page) {
  return page.evaluate(() => window.gs);
}
```

**Playwright config (`playwright.config.js`):**
```javascript
module.exports = {
  testDir: './tests',
  timeout: 60000,
  use: {
    headless: true,
    viewport: { width: 1280, height: 720 },
  },
};
```

## Manual Playthrough Checklist

For each phase, test as a real player:

**Core gameplay:**
- [ ] Start new game, complete onboarding
- [ ] Play through 5 complete years
- [ ] Make varied choices (not always option A)
- [ ] Trigger at least one Grand Venture
- [ ] Die and verify generational handoff works
- [ ] Play 3 years as heir

**Economic systems:**
- [ ] Take a bank loan, verify interest compounds
- [ ] Repay loan, verify credit score improves
- [ ] Take shadow loan, let it go overdue, verify enforcement
- [ ] Commission a ship, verify fleet grows
- [ ] Sell a ship, verify marks increase

**Narrative continuity:**
- [ ] Defer a Borracchi event, verify thread opens
- [ ] Wait 3 years, verify thread returns
- [ ] Resolve thread, verify it closes
- [ ] Check that ledger entries reference past events

**Edge cases:**
- [ ] Reach 0 marks → death screen
- [ ] Reach 0 ships → death screen
- [ ] Reach reputation 10 → verify Legendary effects
- [ ] Reach reputation 1 → verify Disgraced effects
- [ ] Save/load mid-game, verify state persists

## Git Workflow

### Branch Strategy
```bash
git checkout -b feat/choice-preview
# implement Phase 1
git commit -m "feat: add consequence preview to choices"
git checkout main
git merge feat/choice-preview

git checkout -b feat/rival-memory
# implement Phase 2
git commit -m "feat: add persistent rival family memory"
git checkout main
git merge feat/rival-memory

git checkout -b feat/trading-layer
# implement Phase 3
git commit -m "feat: add mid-year trading layer"
git checkout main
git merge feat/trading-layer
```

### Commit Message Format
```
<type>: <description>

- Bullet point of what changed
- Another change
- Tested: <test method>
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `docs`, `refactor`

---

## Timeline Estimate

- **Phase 1 (Choice Preview):** 2-3 hours (simple text append + AI prompt update)
- **Phase 2 (Rival Memory):** 4-6 hours (state tracking + AI integration + UI)
- **Phase 3 (Trading Layer):** 8-12 hours (new UI panel + price system + capacity logic)

**Total:** 14-21 hours for all three features with full testing.

---

## Success Criteria

After all three phases:

1. **Choices feel informed** — players know what they're risking before they commit
2. **The world has memory** — rivals react to past interactions, not just current reputation
3. **Players have agency** — can actively trade, not just react to events
4. **Tests pass** — Playwright suite runs green
5. **Manual play feels good** — 20-year playthrough feels coherent and engaging

The ledger is open. The plan is written. Turn the page.

## #7 Code Refactor — Subtask Plan

### Principles

1. **Strangler Fig** — extract piece by piece, never rewrite. The monolith keeps working at every step.
2. **One file per step** — each sub-task extracts exactly one logical group. No combining steps.
3. **No behaviour changes** — refactoring only. Zero feature changes per sub-task. If you touch logic, stop.
4. **Green at every step** — game must open in browser and pass Playwright tests after each extraction before committing.
5. **Commit after each green step** — small, reversible commits. If a step breaks something, `git checkout` and try again.
6. **No build step** — plain `<script src>` tags in dependency order. All globals stay global. Browser handles the rest.

### File Map (dependency order = load order)

| Sub-task | File | Contents | Deps | Est. lines |
|----------|------|----------|------|------------|
| 7.1 | `hot-game.css` | All CSS from `<style>` block | none | ~350 |
| 7.2 | `hot-data.js` | EPIGRAMS, LOADING_MSGS, YEAR_END_NOTES, HEIR_TRAITS, HEIR_MALE/FEMALE, SITUATION_SEEDS, THREAD_SEEDS, THREAD_FOLLOWUPS, EVENT_GEN_MSGS, TEST_MODEL, `rand()` | none | ~270 |
| 7.3 | `hot-prompts.js` | SYSTEM_PROMPT, EVENT_GEN_PROMPT, ADVISOR_SYSTEM (currently at line 3431 in advisor block — move it here) | none | ~230 |
| 7.4 | `hot-config.js` | CFG_KEY, CFG_DEFAULTS, CFG, `loadCFG`, `saveCFG`, `updateEngineLabel`, `openSettings`, `closeSettings`, `settingsBackendChange`, `saveSettings` | none | ~100 |
| 7.5 | `hot-llm.js` | `callLLM` only | config | ~190 |
| 7.6 | `hot-state.js` | `gs`, `serialiseState`, `deserialiseState`, `autoSave`, `saveToSlot`, `flashSaveSlot`, `loadFromSlot`, `loadAutosave`, `deleteSlot`, `renderSaveOverlay`, `openSaveOverlay`, `closeSaveOverlay`, `renderTitleSaves` | config, data | ~180 |
| 7.7 | `hot-ui.js` | `showNotification`, `showScreen`, `showPanel`, `showError`, `hideError`, `rotateEpigram`, `updateStatusBar`, `renderThreadTracker`, `toggleThreads`, `updateLedgerHistory`, `debugLog`, `renderDebugLog`, `escHtml`, `toggleDebug`, `debugClear`, `debugCopyLast`, `debugEntries` | state, config | ~180 |
| 7.8 | `hot-economy.js` | `rollShipMarket`, `buyShip`, `sellShip`, `getBankRate`, `applyLoanInterest`, `takeBankLoan`, `takeShadowLoan`, `repayLoan`, `showYearEndFinance` | state, ui | ~220 |
| 7.9 | `hot-events.js` | `getSeason`, `pickSeed`, `generateEvent`, `checkAndShowRoutes`, `showHouseEvent`, `showRoutesEvent`, `pickVentureSeed`, `showVenture`, `analyzeChoiceRisk`, `renderChoices` | state, ui, llm, prompts, data | ~280 |
| 7.10 | `hot-engine.js` | `startGame`, `launchGame`, `beginPhase`, `advancePhase`, `beginYear`, `makeChoice`, `seed_label_from_type`, `showResult`, `showYearEnd`, `showDeathScreen`, `generationalHandoff`, `resetGame`, `renderOnboard`, `onboardNext`, `onboardPrev`, `skipOnboard`, `advisorOpen`, `toggleAdvisor`, `askAdvisor`, `testConnection`, `_origBeginPhase`/`_origShowResult` hooks (these two MUST be last in file, after originals are defined) | everything | ~670 |
| 7.11 | `tests/unit.spec.js` | Unit tests for pure functions: `analyzeChoiceRisk`, `getSeason`, `seed_label_from_type`, `serialiseState`/`deserialiseState` round-trip | — | ~80 |
| 7.12 | `house-of-tide.html` | Final cleanup — HTML shell only. Just structure + `<link>` + `<script>` tags. No inline JS or CSS. | — | ~120 |

### Per-step Protocol — MANDATORY, NO EXCEPTIONS

Every sub-task must complete ALL SIX steps before the next sub-task begins.
Steps 5 and 6 are not optional. Do not skip them. Do not combine steps across sub-tasks.

```
1. Create new file with extracted code (copy-paste only — do not edit logic)
2. Delete the same code from house-of-tide.html
3. Add <script src="hot-xxx.js"> or <link rel="stylesheet"> in correct position
4. Open house-of-tide.html in browser — spot check: start game, make a choice, verify nothing is visually broken
5. npx playwright test — ALL tests must pass before proceeding
6. git add hot-xxx.js house-of-tide.html && git commit
```

**Hard gates:**
- If step 5 fails → fix the error, re-run step 5. Do not proceed to step 6 or the next sub-task until green.
- If step 4 shows visual breakage → fix before running tests.
- A sub-task is only COMPLETE when the commit exists. "Extracted but not committed" = not done.

### Script tag order in HTML (7.12 target state)

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="hot-game.css">
<!-- in <head> -->

<script src="hot-data.js"></script>
<script src="hot-prompts.js"></script>
<script src="hot-config.js"></script>
<script src="hot-llm.js"></script>
<script src="hot-state.js"></script>
<script src="hot-ui.js"></script>
<script src="hot-economy.js"></script>
<script src="hot-events.js"></script>
<script src="hot-engine.js"></script>
<!-- before </body> -->
```

### Things to watch for — audited against actual code

**1. Monkey-patches execute at parse time — critical load order issue**

`_origBeginPhase = beginPhase` (line 3496) and `_origShowResult = showResult` (line 3749) are top-level `const` assignments. They execute the moment their script is parsed. `beginPhase` and `showResult` must already be defined at that point.

Fix: both monkey-patches go at the **bottom of `hot-engine.js`**, after their target functions are defined. Do not put them in any earlier-loaded file.

**2. `testConnection` is NOT a clean LLM function — wrong file in plan**

`testConnection` (line 3765) reads DOM elements (`test-btn`, `test-result`), hardcodes Ollama-specific fetch logic, and references `TEST_MODEL` from `hot-data.js`. It belongs in `hot-engine.js`, not `hot-llm.js`. Move accordingly.

**3. `ADVISOR_SYSTEM` is not grouped with other prompts in the current file**

Currently sits at line 3431 sandwiched inside the advisor block between `toggleAdvisor` and `askAdvisor`. When extracting, move it to `hot-prompts.js` with the other prompts. Leave `toggleAdvisor`, `advisorOpen`, and `askAdvisor` in `hot-engine.js`.

**4. Two `DOMContentLoaded` handlers — both safe, different homes**

- Line 1322: registers the ollama model change listener. Lives in `hot-config.js`. Fine.
- Line 3756: calls `loadCFG()`, `renderTitleSaves()`, `rotateEpigram()`. These functions end up across `hot-config.js`, `hot-state.js`, `hot-engine.js`. This handler goes in `hot-state.js`. It's safe because `DOMContentLoaded` fires after ALL scripts at the bottom of `<body>` have run — all functions are available.

**5. `gs` uses `Set` — handled, but verify**

`gs.usedHouse`, `gs.usedRoutes`, `gs.usedVentures` are `Set` objects. `serialiseState` spreads them to arrays; `deserialiseState` reconstructs them. This is already correct — just don't accidentally assign plain arrays to these fields anywhere during the refactor.

**6. `const` re-declaration will throw**

During each extraction step: delete the code from the HTML first, then reload. Never have the same `const` declared in both the HTML and an external file simultaneously. Git staging gives you a safety net.

**7. Inline `onclick=` in HTML calls global functions — safe by design**

All functions stay global (no `export`/`import`). Inline handlers will resolve correctly as long as the scripts are loaded before user interaction, which they are (all scripts at bottom of `<body>`, loaded before any click is possible).

### Commit message format

```
refactor: extract <description> into <filename>

- Moved: list of functions/constants moved
- No logic changes
- Tested: browser spot check + npx playwright test

## 📋 MANUAL PLAYTHROUGH CHECKLIST

**⚠️ NOTE: Most of these can be replaced with automated Playwright tests.**
**Run manual tests only for subjective quality checks (prose quality, choice meaningfulness).**

### ✅ Automated with Playwright (tests/gameplay-loop.spec.js, tests/edge-cases.spec.js)
- [x] Start new game, complete onboarding
- [x] Play through 5 complete years
- [x] Make varied choices (test uses different indices)
- [x] Economic systems track (marks, ships, reputation)
- [x] Ledger entries accumulate
- [x] Save/load persists state
- [x] Loan system exists in state
- [x] Heir trait affects gameplay
- [x] Background images load (LoremFlickr)
- [x] MLX backend connection works
- [x] Settings panel MLX debug info displays

### ⬜ Still Needs Manual Testing (Subjective)
- [ ] Trigger at least one Grand Venture (AI-dependent, rare)
- [ ] Die and verify generational handoff works (requires age manipulation or very long test)
- [ ] Play 3 years as heir (requires death first)
- [ ] Defer a Borracchi event, verify thread opens (AI-dependent)
- [ ] Wait 3 years, verify thread returns (AI-dependent)
- [ ] Check that ledger entries reference past events (subjective quality)
- [ ] Reach reputation 10 → verify Legendary effects (very hard to achieve)
- [ ] Reach reputation 1 → verify Disgraced effects (very hard to achieve)
- [ ] **Prose quality** — does AI narrative make sense?
- [ ] **Choice meaningfulness** — do choices feel impactful?
- [ ] **Pell advisor** — is counsel helpful and contextual?

## 🔧 MAKING OLLAMA SETUP EASIER

### Current Problem
Users must run these commands manually:

---

## ⚠️ DEPRECATED / NOT RECOMMENDED

### ~~Reduce AI Calls~~ — **REMOVED**
**Why:** Caching similar events would make the game stale and repetitive. The AI dungeon master should keep interactions fresh and interesting, not stale and repetitive. The prefetch system we built is the correct approach - it caches outcomes for CURRENT choices only, maintaining variety while improving responsiveness.
```bash
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
killall Ollama
open -a Ollama
```

### Solution 1: Create Setup Script (5 min)
Create `/usr/local/bin/setup-ollama-cors`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Setting up Ollama CORS..."
launchctl setenv OLLAMA_ORIGINS "*"
killall Ollama 2>/dev/null
sleep 2
open -a Ollama
echo "✓ Ollama restarted with CORS enabled!"
echo "Wait for llama icon in menu bar, then test connection."
```

Make executable: `chmod +x /usr/local/bin/setup-ollama-cors`

Users run: `setup-ollama-cors`

### Solution 2: In-Game Setup Button (30 min)
Add button in settings when Ollama selected:
```
⚠️ Ollama requires CORS setup
[🔧 Auto-Setup Ollama] ← Click to run setup script
```

Clicking runs AppleScript to execute the commands.

### Solution 3: Better Detection (1 hour)
Add CORS detection in `testConnection()`:
- If Ollama fails with CORS error, show:
  - "CORS not enabled" message
  - Copy-paste commands in clickable code blocks
  - Link to setup script

### Solution 4: Remove Ollama Requirement (Best, 2+ hours)
Modify game to not require CORS by:
- Using a proxy server (Node.js local server)
- Or recommend users stick with MLX (same models, no CORS issues)

---

## 📋 RECOMMENDED OLLAMA IMPROVEMENT

**Best approach:** Create setup script + in-game detection

1. **Create `/usr/local/bin/ollama-cors`** (5 min)
2. **Add detection in testConnection()** (30 min)
3. **Show helpful message with one-line fix** (15 min)

**Or:** Just recommend MLX instead of Ollama — same local models, no CORS needed!

---

## ✅ WHAT'S WORKING NOW

### Fully Tested & Working (16 Playwright tests ✅)
- ✅ Game initializes with correct state
- ✅ Background images load from LoremFlickr
- ✅ Event loads with choices (plain text, not JSON)
- ✅ Settings panel with MLX debug info
- ✅ MLX API responds
- ✅ Advisor (Pell) panel opens
- ✅ Heir trait system displays
- ✅ Risk detection on choices (costs, requirements, warnings)
- ✅ Code refactor (12 modular files)

### Partially Working (Needs Implementation)
- ⚠️ Rival memory (state exists, auto-tracking missing)
- ⚠️ Trading layer (state exists, UI/pricing missing)

### What Playwright Can't Test (Manual Only)
1. **AI narrative quality** — Does the story make sense?
2. **Choice meaningfulness** — Do decisions feel impactful?
3. **Thread continuity** — Does AI remember past events?
4. **Grand Venture triggers** — Rare, AI-dependent
5. **Death/handoff** — Requires age manipulation or 30+ year test
6. **Reputation extremes** — Very hard to reach rep 1 or 10

**Recommendation:** Run fast tests before every commit (`npx playwright test tests/fast-ui-tests.spec.js tests/choice-rendering.spec.js tests/choice-preview.spec.js`). Manual testing only for subjective quality (30 min per release).

---

## 📝 NOTES

### What's Actually Done vs. Partially Done

**Fully Implemented:**
- ✅ Choice preview (risk detection on choices)
- ✅ Code refactor (12 modular files)
- ✅ MLX backend fixes (testConnection, JSON parsing, debug info)
- ✅ Playwright test infrastructure (17 passing tests)
- ✅ Prefetch optimization (caches outcomes for MLX/Ollama)

**Partially Implemented (state exists, logic missing):**
- ⚠️ Rival memory — `gs.rivals` exists, `getRivalContext()` works, but no auto-tracking
- ⚠️ Trading layer — `gs.cargo` and `gs.marketPrices` exist, no UI or pricing logic

**Broken:**
- 🔥 Background images — Unsplash API dead since 2023
